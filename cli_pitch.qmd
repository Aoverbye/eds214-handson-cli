---

## A little bit of terminology


- `Command Line Interface (CLI)`: This is a user interface that lets you interact with a computer. It is a legacy from the early days of computers. Now a days computers have graphical user interfaces instead (MacOSX, Windows, Linux, ...) 
- `Terminal`: It is a an application that lets you run a command line interface. It used to be a physical machine connected to a mainframe computer
- `Shell`: It is the program that runs the command line. Thera are many different shells, the most common (an default on most system) being `bash` (Bourne Again SHell)


## Why should I learn about bash !?

```{bash}
# Clone this repository
cd ~
mkdir Github
cd Github
git clone "https://github.com/brunj7/eds214-handson-cli.git"
cd eds214-handson-cli
cd babynamesbystate
pwd


# Do I have all the states?
ls *.TXT
ls *.TXT | wc -l

# Look at the files
head CA.TXT
tail CA.TXT

# Concatenate the files
touch baby_allstates.csv     # create an empty file
echo "state, gender, year, firstname, count" > baby_allstates.csv  # add the header to the file
cat *.TXT >> baby_allstates.csv    # append the content of the files to the csv file
```
